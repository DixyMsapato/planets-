Welcome to mars. 
=======
Cold and dry but everything is my favourite colour, which is red.  However two moons is a problem for the
Wolfman.
However the martians are perfectly nice people. Not the sort you'd want to sit with
on a long coach journey, but nice nonetheless. 
However the mummy will enjoy the humidity. See also venus.txt for alternative plan. 
:). Maybe we should go to Vaenus and beyong as well.
It will be quite hot there.
